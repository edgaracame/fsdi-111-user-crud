Mini Challenge 2

Create scripts to manually test our update and our deactivate endpoints.

    - To issue a PUT request, you can use the "put()" function associated with the requests module like so:

        response = requests.put(URL, json=SOMETHING)
    
    To issue a DELETE request, you can use the "delete()" function associated with the requests module like so:

        responde = requests.delete(URL)
